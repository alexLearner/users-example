This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
UI based on [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

In all links need use ROOT const (src/config.js) for gh-pages routing;

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

* The production version will not work on localhost, since the variable in production ROOT = 'users-example' for gp-pages
